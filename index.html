        <p>I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Criminal Justice Research Center at Penn State University. <strong></strong></p>
		
		<p>In this role, I work closely with the Bureau of Planning, Research & Statistics at the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. My postdoctoral work focuses on the causal effects of parole supervision in the United States.  First, I investigate the effects of early release from prison using the randomized assignment of parole board members and hearing examiners to parole hearings in Pennsylvania.<strong></strong></p>
		
		<p>Second, I separately identify the effects of the three major components of parole supervision – (1) special conditions such as curfew or placement in a halfway house, (2) parole supervision intensity, and (3) the parole officer who manages supervision.  To do so, I leverage three separate quasi-experimental assignment mechanisms – random assignment of parole board members and hearing examiners who set special conditions, recidivism risk test score discontinuities that determine supervision intensity, and the random assignment of parole officers.<strong></strong></p>
		
		<p>Third, I delve deeply into the effects of the relationship between parolees and parole officers. Here, I investigate the effects of parole officer provided interpersonal and structural support, as captured by a survey of parole officers’ approaches to their jobs in Pennsylvania.  In addition, I investigate the impact of racial and gender bias in parolee-parole officer relationships, by analyzing the extent to which the assignment of officers of the opposite race and sex impact a parolee’s post-release outcomes.<strong></strong></p>
		
		<p>More broadly, my research focuses on ways to improve criminal justice and education policy, leveraging both quasi-experimental and experimental methods. Criminal justice research includes evaluations of prison programming on pre- and post-release outcomes and the effects of re-entry forums for recently paroled individuals who had committed a violent crime with a gun.  In addition, it includes evaluations of the effect of gang-takedown policies on community violence, an exploration of the factors that impact police officer arrest and use-of-force decisions, the effects of an initiative to reduce crime by reducing anonymity between police officers and neighborhood residents, and the effect of streetlights on crime.<strong></strong></p>
		
		<p>Education research includes an evaluation of the effects of career and technical education for secondary school students relative to other high school courses, leveraging structural modeling techniques and policy simulations, and an evaluation of how these effects have changed over the last 50 years.  It also includes an evaluation of the effects of math tutoring programs for high school students who are behind grade level by pairing a proven low-student-to-tutor-ratio tutoring course with education technology software to reduce its cost.<strong></strong></p>
		
		<p>I hold a PhD in economics from the University of Virginia and a BS in economics & political science from the University of Michigan.  Prior to this position, I worked as a research director at Crime & Education Lab New York, managing a combination of policy evaluations and technical assistance projects for several New York City government agencies.</p>
