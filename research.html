        <p><b>Perceptions of Known Strangers</b>
		<br>with Anuj Shaw
		<br>Conditionally Accepted, <i>Nature</i>
		<br><i>Draft Available Upon Request</a></i></p>
		<p>Social ties can be asymmetric. For example, people might know a stranger better than the stranger knows them. Here, we explore people’s perceptions of such “known” strangers. Across several lab experiments, we find that people overlook this asymmetry: When people learn more about a stranger, they feel like the stranger also knows them better, and they act as if known strangers are more attuned to their actions. This finding has important policy implications. As an illustrative example, we applied this insight to one of today’s most pressing policy challenges—changing policing. People often know little about their neighborhood officers. We address this with a field experiment, where we find that delivering information about neighborhood police officers shifted peoples’ perceptions of officers’ knowledge of illegal activity, and it may even have reduced crime. It appears that our sense of anonymity depends not just on what people know about us, but on what we know about them.</p>

		<p><b>Can Precision Policing Reduce Gun Violence? Evidence from “Gang Takedowns” in New York City</b>
		<br>with Aaron Chalfin and Jacob Kaplan
		<br><i>Journal of Policy Analysis & Management</i>
		<br><i><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.22323" style="color: #000000">Paper</a></i></p>
		<p>During the last decade, while national homicide rates have remained flat, New York City has experienced a second great crime decline, with gun violence declining by more than 50 percent since 2011. In this paper, we investigate one potential explanation for this dramatic and unexpected improvement in public safety — the New York Police Department’s shift to a more surgical form of “precision policing”, in which law enforcement focuses resources on a small number of individuals who are thought to be the primary drivers of violence. We study New York City’s campaign of “gang takedowns” in which suspected members of criminal gangs were arrested in highly coordinated raids and prosecuted on conspiracy charges. We show that gun violence in and around public housing communities fell by approximately one third in the first year after a gang takedown. Our estimates imply that gang takedowns explain nearly one quarter of the decline in gun violence in New York City’s public housing communities over the last eight years.</p>

		<p><b>The Effects of High School Career and Technical Education on Employment, Wages, and Educational Attainment</b>
		<br>Revise & Resubmit, <i>Journal of Human Capital</i>
		<br><i><a href="CTE_3_9_21_LaForest.pdf" style="color: #000000">Draft</a>; </i><i><a href="Data_Appendix_11_11_20_LaForest.pdf" style="color: #000000">Data Appendix</a>; </i><i><a href="CTE_Code.zip" style="color: #000000">Stata, Matlab, and Fortran Code</a></i></p>
		<p>I present a dynamic structural model of individual choice regarding high school education curricula, post-secondary education attainment, and early labor market opportunities, with a focus on career and technical high school education (CTE). I use panel data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and instrument for high school curricula choice using CTE opportunities and local labor market controls. Estimates suggest that trade CTE, relative to general education and business CTE, improves students’ wages and employment opportunities. Estimates also suggest that CTE decreases students’ high school drop-out propensity but also their propensity to pursue four-year post-secondary education degrees. Policy simulations suggest that incorporating vocational certification into high school CTE would cause more students to take CTE courses and improve their labor market outcomes, and that instituting a strict high school tracking system would improve education and labor market outcomes for high school graduates at the expense of their high school utility while decreasing the high school graduation rate. A final exploratory simulation suggests that providing free tuition to community college would cause a greater share of students to enroll in high school general education courses, increase graduation from community colleges, slightly increase graduation from four-year colleges and universities, and slightly increase average wages. Whether these gains offset the costs of the policy depend on assumptions about the relative marginal welfare of high and low socioeconomic status individuals and who bears the cost. </p>

		<p><b>Street Light Outages, Public Safety and Crime Attraction</b>
		<br>with Aaron Chalfin and Jacob Kaplan
		<br><i>Journal of Quantitative Criminology</i>
		<br><i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10940-021-09519-4" style="color: #000000">Paper</a></i></p>
		<p><i>Objectives:</i> For more than one hundred years, street lighting has been one of the most ubiquitous capital investments in public safety. Prior research on street lighting is largely limited to ecological studies of very small geographic areas, creating substantial challenges with respect to both causal identification and statistical power. We address limitations of the prior literature by studying a natural experiment created by short-term disruptions to municipal street lighting. <i>Methods:</i> We leverage a natural experiment created by the differential timing of the repair of nearly 300,000 street light outages in Chicago. By conditioning on street segment fixed effects and focusing on a short window of time around the repair of a street light outage, we can credibly rule out confounding factors due to area-specific time trends as well as street segment-level correlates of crime. <i>Results:</i> We find that outdoor nighttime crimes change very little on street segments affected by street light outages, but that outages cause crime to spill over to nearby street segments. Effects are largest for robberies and motor vehicle theft. <i>Conclusions:</i> Despite strong environmental and social characteristics that tend to tie crime to place, we observe that street light outages are sufficiently salient to disrupt longstanding patterns. While the impact of localized street light outages can reverberate throughout a community, the findings imply that improvements in lighting can be defeated by the displacement of crime to adjacent spaces and therefore do not necessarily suggest that localized investments in municipal street lighting will yield a large public safety dividend.</p>

		<p><b>Parole Conditions and Early Release at the Margin</b>
		<br><i>Draft Available Upon Request</a></i></p>
		<p>While over 70% of U.S. prisoners are released under parole supervision, relatively little is known about the effects of supervised release.  In this work, I first investigate the effects of early release from prison using the randomized assignment of parole board members and hearing examiners to parole hearings in Pennsylvania.  I discuss whether, at the margin of release, individuals initially paroled experience lower rates of recidivism and higher rates of employment than individuals denied parole and released at a later date.  Second, I separately identify the effects of three major components of parole supervision.  Specifically, (1) parole-hearing-imposed special conditions such as curfew or placement in a halfway house, (2) parole supervision intensity level (determined by recidivism risk test score discontinuities), and (3) the parole officer who oversees supervision (assigned randomly at release).</p>

		<p><b>A Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Effect of the New York State Gun Violence Reduction Program</b>
		<br>with Oludamilare Aboaba, Benjamin Hansen, Lucie Parker, and Patrick Sharkey
		<br><i>Draft Available Upon Request</a></i></p>
		<p>In this paper we study the impact of the Gun Violence Reduction Project (GVRP), a targeted intervention designed to reduce involvement with gun violence among parolees with a violent felony conviction or a firearm arrest.  Based on a unique partnership between New York State, multiple law enforcement agencies, and a variety of social service providers, the GVRP led monthly group meetings (also known as “notification forums”) where parolees were notified of the sanctions for reoffending on parole and offered community resources to support their integration into their community. An evaluation based upon randomized assignment to the parole forums suggests this reentry program did not impact gun violence or create community spillover effects, but did reduce parole violations - overall violations fell by 15 percent while absconding fell by 25 percent.  We discuss potential mechanisms and challenges for other similar programs.</p>

		<p><b>Comparing COVID-19 Mortality Rates between Prisons and the Community</b>
		<br>with Kristofer B. Bucklen 
		<br>Under Review
		<br><i>Draft Available Upon Request</a></i></p>
		<p>Policy-makers need the best available evidence to inform policy decisions during public health emergencies.  We illustrate this in the context of temporary prisoner release decisions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We leverage parolee COVID-19 mortality rates in PA to show that prior estimates of the expected COVID-19 mortality rate for prisoners once released into the community, calculated from community rates, underestimate expected deaths by a factor of over 2.5.  These results show a substantially smaller return to public health from temporary prisoner release programs than previously estimated and show that, in some settings, such programs may increase COVID-19 risk.  They also highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate comparison group when estimating policy counterfactuals.</p>

		<p><b>Variation in Mental Illness and Provision of Public Services</b>
		<br>with William C. Johnson, Brett Lissenden, and Steven Stern
		<br><i>Health Services and Outcomes Research Methodology</i> 17, 1-30 (2017)
		<br><i><a href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1007/s10742-016-0167-3?author_access_token=MW1XCH29-baGaIJrh7qr1ve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4AikW1FvyhVuI2SwQnuOBjKw3JzfwyKyPqKX72tfehH_7gT3L3W0hQZ7v35lzRQgcsCZE6dPGudcK5IyQUkeL_yN5qcrHTofDZjFFzOyhF-w%3D%3D" style="color: #000000">Paper</a></i></p>
		<p>By providing affordable healthcare to many Americans for the first time, the Affordable Care Act increases demand for public mental health services. It is, however, unclear if states' provision standards for supply of mental health services will be able to accommodate this demand increase. Both the demand and supply of public mental health services vary within states; it is necessary to measure both locally. In this paper, we estimate the prevalence of mental illness within 30 geographical regions in the state of Virginia, a representative example of how many states organize their public mental health systems and how mental illness prevalence can be measured locally. Our methodology extends the analysis in Stern (2014) by covering an entire state and accounting for peoples' insurance status. The latter allows us to compare estimates of demand for public mental health services among those 30 geographical regions. We find that over 66,000 uninsured and Medicaid-insured individuals in Virginia are not provided with public mental health services. The deficit varies locally, with several regions having no deficit and others having 5000 or more untreated people. We also estimate that a large portion of the unserved people with mental illness are uninsured but would be insured for mental health services through Medicaid if Virginia were to accept the Medicaid expansion associated with the Affordable Care Act. These results provide evidence that there is significant variation in the demand for and public health systems' ability to supply mental health services within states. This implies states can better serve populations relying on mental health care by allocating scarce public mental health dollars to localities reflecting their need.</p>

		<p><b>Wald Test for Common Mean Probabilities across Geographic Areas</b>
		<br>with Steven Stern
		<br><i>Draft Available Upon Request</a></i></p>
		<p>We show how one can construct a Wald test, to test for variation in estimates across locations, in the presence of small area-specific random effects which have a non-linear covariance structure.  The methodology is applied to estimates of mental illness prevalence for small areas in Virginia described in more detail in Johnson et al. (2016).</p>

		<p><b>Racial Bias and the Effects of Parole Agent Assignment on Reentry</b></p>
		<p>Over 70% of U.S. prisoners are released under parole supervision, yet relatively little is known about the effects of supervised release.  Using the randomized assignment of parole agents to parolees in Pennsylvania, I investigate the effect of parole agent assignment on post-release outcomes.  First, I discuss whether assignments of agents of the opposite race and sex lead to increased rates of technical parole violations, arrests for new crimes, and unemployment.  Next, I discuss the extent to which agent years of service and agent perspectives about their role and relationship with assigned parolees, as measured through agent survey responses, relate to parolee reentry outcomes. Finally, I discuss the proportions of post-incarceration recidivism and employment rates that can be directly attributed to parole agent assignment.</p>

		<p><b>Increasing the Reach of Promising Individualized Academic Supports: Experimental Evidence of a Lower-Cost Technology-Infused Intervention</b>
		<br>with Monica Bhatt and Jonathan Guryan<br></b></p>
		<p>Previous evaluations have found that SAGA Innovations’ individualized, high-intensity daily math tutoring program, delivered as a course during the school day, can substantially improve outcomes for youth (Cook et al., 2015). However, the intervention’s cost ($3,000 per pupil) is prohibitively expensive for many school districts to bear at large-scale. In collaboration with SAGA, we are studying the effectiveness of a lower-cost technology-enhanced version of this intervention that employs an ed-tech learning platform (like Khan Academy) to supplement in-person instruction. This study seeks to determine if technology-enhanced tutoring generates similar academic gains to SAGA’s traditional model, while substantially reducing the cost-per-student. This study is taking place in academic years (AY) 2018-19 and 2019-20 across several Chicago and New York City public high schools.  If found to be effective, this lower-cost model has the potential to scale up in Chicago, New York City, and far beyond, to ensure that more students have the personalized support they need to succeed.</p>

		<p><b>Temporal Bias in Officer Arrest and Use of Force Decisions – Evidence from Dallas</b></p>
		<p>Prior work has shown differences in arrest and use of force propensity across officers in the same police department.  This work investigates the extent to which individual officers show differences in arrest and use of force propensity from one arrest to the next, based on the prior crimes the officer responded to that day, the time already spent on shift that day, and other exogenous factors impacting the officer at the time of the call.  I then discuss the extent to which these within-officer differences can be used as an instrument to evaluate the long-term effects of arrests and use of force incidents on potential arrestees.</p>

		<p><b>A Comparison of the Effects of High School Career and Technical Education over the Past Four Decades</b></p>
		<p>Using the dynamic structural model developed in LaForest (2021), I estimate and compare the effects of U.S. high school career and technical education (CTE) in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.  I do so by estimating the parameters of the dynamic structural model using restricted-use data from each of the four panel data sets conducted by the National Center for Education Studies: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), High School and Beyond (HS&B), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002).  I compare these results in order to provide context on how the returns to high school CTE have changed over time in the United States, to predict how the returns to high school CTE will change in the future, and to evaluate the robustness of my parameter estimates over time.  Finally, I test how well my model predicts the data by treating ELS:2002 as a hold-out sample and using the trends in the NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 model estimates to predict the data in ELS:2002. A preliminary comparison of results between the ELS:2002 and NELS:88 data sets suggests that the effects of high school CTE on later-life wages and chances of employment in a skilled occupation remained relatively constant between the 1990s and 2000s, but that the effects of trade CTE on overall employment decreased from positive to negligible between the 1990s and 2000s.</p>

		<p><b>The Effects of Mandatory Minimum Sentence Laws on Crime, Incarceration, and Plea Bargaining</b></p>
		<p>I estimate the effects of U.S. mandatory minimum sentence laws on crime rates, incarceration rates, and plea bargaining rates using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy.  First, I compile all state and national mandatory minimum law changes over the past 25 years, with a particular focus on mandatory minimum sentence laws relating to drug crimes (marijuana, cocaine, and heroine).  I use plea bargaining data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) State Court Processing (SCP) statistics, which covers 40 of the most populous counties in the United States, located across 25 states.  I use incarceration data from the BJS’s National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program, and crime data from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program and the National Incidence-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).  Complied mandatory minimum law changes show that, over time, southern states have had the harshest mandatory minimum sentence laws followed by states in the upper Midwest, while states in the west and lower Midwest have had the most lenient mandatory minimum sentence laws.  Additionally, compiled mandatory minimum law changes show that there has been substantial number of minor and moderate changes in state mandatory minimum sentence laws over the past 25 years, both in the crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences and in the sentences for those crimes.  Preliminary estimation results are forthcoming.</p>
