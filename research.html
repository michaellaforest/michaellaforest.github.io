        <p><b>The Effects of High School Career and Technical Education for Non-College Bound Students</b><br><i><a href="Michael_LaForest_CTE.pdf" style="color: #000000">Paper (Link)</a></i><br><i><a href="CTE_Data_Appendix.pdf" style="color: #000000">Data Appendix (Link)</a></i><br><i><a href="CTE_Code.zip" style="color: #000000">Stata, Matlab, and Fortran Code (Link)</a></i></p>
		<p>I present a dynamic structural model of individual choice regarding high school education curricula, post-secondary education attainment, and early labor market opportunities.  I estimate the model to investigate the returns to education from different types of U.S. high school curricula, with a particular focus on career and technical education (CTE) for non-college bound students.  I estimate the model using panel data on students’ high school course selection and labor market outcomes from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, and I account for high school curriculum self-selection by including instruments in the model for high school CTE and academic opportunities along with local labor market controls.  The estimates suggest that, relative to general education courses, trade CTE courses improve a non-college bound student’s later labor market wages and chance of being employed in a skilled occupation, while business CTE courses improve wages in low-wage / high-non-pecuniary utility occupations.  In addition, the estimates suggest that increased CTE opportunities decrease a non-college bound student’s propensity to drop out of high school, but that CTE courses decrease a high school graduate’s likelihood to pursue a post-secondary education degree.   Policy simulations suggest that incorporating vocational certification into high school CTE curricula would cause more students to take CTE courses and improve their labor market outcomes and that instituting a German-style high school tracking system in the United States would improve the education and labor market outcomes of high school graduates at the expense of their non-pecuniary utility in high school.  Policy simulations also suggest that providing free tuition to community college would cause more students to take general education courses in high school, increase graduation from community colleges, slightly increase graduation from four-year colleges and universities, and slightly increase average wages in the population. </p>

		<p><b>Variation in Mental Illness and Provision of Public Services</b><br>with William C. Johnson, Brett Lissenden, and Steven Stern<br><i>Health Services and Outcomes Research Methodology, 2016</i><br><i><a href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1007/s10742-016-0167-3?author_access_token=MW1XCH29-baGaIJrh7qr1ve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4AikW1FvyhVuI2SwQnuOBjKw3JzfwyKyPqKX72tfehH_7gT3L3W0hQZ7v35lzRQgcsCZE6dPGudcK5IyQUkeL_yN5qcrHTofDZjFFzOyhF-w%3D%3D" style="color: #000000">Paper (Link)</a></i></p>
		<p>By providing affordable healthcare to many Americans for the first time, the Affordable Care Act increases demand for public mental health services. It is, however, unclear if states' provision standards for supply of mental health services will be able to accommodate this demand increase. Both the demand and supply of public mental health services vary within states; it is necessary to measure both locally. In this paper, we estimate the prevalence of mental illness within 30 geographical regions in the state of Virginia, a representative example of how many states organize their public mental health systems and how mental illness prevalence can be measured locally. Our methodology extends the analysis in Stern (2014) by covering an entire state and accounting for peoples' insurance status. The latter allows us to compare estimates of demand for public mental health services among those 30 geographical regions. We find that over 66,000 uninsured and Medicaid-insured individuals in Virginia are not provided with public mental health services. The deficit varies locally, with several regions having no deficit and others having 5000 or more untreated people. We also estimate that a large portion of the unserved people with mental illness are uninsured but would be insured for mental health services through Medicaid if Virginia were to accept the Medicaid expansion associated with the Affordable Care Act. These results provide evidence that there is significant variation in the demand for and public health systems' ability to supply mental health services within states. This implies states can better serve populations relying on mental health care by allocating scarce public mental health dollars to localities reflecting their need.</p>

		<p><b>Promoting Prosociality by Learning about Others</b><br>with Hannah Furstenberg-Beckman and Anuj Shaw<br><i>Paper Available Upon Request</a></i></p>
		<p>People often encounter situations in which they do not know others and others do not know them. Such anonymity can decrease prosocial behavior. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel approach to reducing feelings of anonymity. Across a series of lab experiments, we find that when people have more information about others, they believe that others have more information about them. In another lab experiment, we leverage this principle to increase prosocial behavior. When participants were given mundane facts about a person tasked with detecting cheating behavior, participants were less likely to cheat. Finally, in a field study, we used this principle to design a large-scale policing intervention across housing developments in New York City with over 100,000 residents. We find that giving residents mundane facts about their neighborhood officers (a) increases their belief that officers would know if residents broke the law and (b) reduces crime around the housing developments.</p>

		<p><b>The Effect of Ambient Lighting on Crime: Evidence from Street Light Outages in America’s Three Largest Cities</b><br>with Aaron Chalfin and Jacob Kaplan<br><i>Paper Available Upon Request</a></i></p>
		<p>For more than one hundred years, one of the most common and enduring capital investments that cities have relied on to maintain public safety is street lighting.  This research provides the most comprehensive examination of the effect of street lighting on crime, to date, by considering the responsiveness of crime to nearly 300,000 street light outages in Chicago,the third largest city in the United States.  We find that outdoor nighttime crimes change very little on street segments affected by multiple street light outages.  However, the evidence also suggests that crime spills over appreciably to adjacent street segments, indicating that crime may follow patterns of human activity and that the impact of a localized street light outage can reverberate throughout a community.  Interestingly, there is little evidence that crime issensitive to a single street light outage, suggesting that the effect of lighting is non-linear.</p>

		<p><b>Wald Test for Common Mean Probabilities across Geographic Areas</b><br>with Steven Stern<br><i><a href="waldtest.pdf" style="color: #000000">Paper (Link)</a></i></p>
		<p>We show how one can construct a Wald test, to test for variation in estimates across locations, in the presence of small area-specific random effects which have a non-linear covariance structure.  The methodology is applied to estimates of mental illness prevalence for small areas in Virginia described in more detail in Johnson et al. (2016).</p>

		<p><b>Increasing the Reach of Promising Individualized Academic Supports: Experimental Evidence of a Lower-Cost Technology-Infused Intervention</b><br>with Monica Bhatt and Jonathan Guryan<br></b></p>
		<p>Previous evaluations have found that SAGA Innovations’ individualized, high-intensity daily math tutoring program, delivered as a course during the school day, can substantially improve outcomes for youth (Cook et al., 2015). However, the intervention’s cost ($3,000 per pupil) is prohibitively expensive for many school districts to bear at large-scale. In collaboration with SAGA, we are studying the effectiveness of a lower-cost technology-enhanced version of this intervention that employs an ed-tech learning platform (like Khan Academy) to supplement in-person instruction. This study seeks to determine if technology-enhanced tutoring generates similar academic gains to SAGA’s traditional model, while substantially reducing the cost-per-student. This study is taking place in academic years (AY) 2018-19 and 2019-20 across several Chicago and New York City public high schools.  If found to be effective, this lower-cost model has the potential to scale up in Chicago, New York City, and far beyond, to ensure that more students have the personalized support they need to succeed.</p>

		<p><b>Evaluating the Effects of Parole Forums in New York: Expanding the Evaluation of the New York State Gun Violence Reduction Project</b><br>with Benjamin Hansen and Patrick Sharkey<br></b></p>
		<p>With city, state, and national attention focused on decreasing prison and jail populations, the need to reduce recidivism and help returning citizens safely and successfully transition home is more critical than ever. Some cities have begun implementing a promising approach to reducing recidivism (and violence) called reentry forums. Led by law enforcement and social service representatives, reentry forums engage former violent offenders who are now on parole with messages of both deterrence and community support in a setting that conveys mutual respect and legitimacy. To evaluate the effects of these forums, we are conducting an extended analysis of the New York State Gun Violence Reduction Project, a randomized control trial of reentry forums that took place in 2013-2014. We seek to provide rigorous evidence about the effects of the project by are measuring neighborhood and individual-level program effects over a multiple-year follow-up period. Data is provided by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, the Department of Criminal Justice Services, and the Manhattan District Attorney’s office.  </p>

		<p><b>The Effects of Mandatory Minimum Sentence Laws on Crime, Incarceration, and Plea Bargaining</b></p>
		<p>I estimate the effects of U.S. mandatory minimum sentence laws on crime rates, incarceration rates, and plea bargaining rates using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy.  First, I compile all state and national mandatory minimum law changes over the past 25 years, with a particular focus on mandatory minimum sentence laws relating to drug crimes (marijuana, cocaine, and heroine).  I use plea bargaining data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) State Court Processing (SCP) statistics, which covers 40 of the most populous counties in the United States, located across 25 states.  I use incarceration data from the BJS’s National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program, and crime data from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program and the National Incidence-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).  Complied mandatory minimum law changes show that, over time, southern states have had the harshest mandatory minimum sentence laws followed by states in the upper Midwest, while states in the west and lower Midwest have had the most lenient mandatory minimum sentence laws.  Additionally, compiled mandatory minimum law changes show that there has been substantial number of minor and moderate changes in state mandatory minimum sentence laws over the past 25 years, both in the crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences and in the sentences for those crimes.  Preliminary estimation results are forthcoming.</p>

		<p><b>A Comparison of the Effects of High School Career and Technical Education over the Past Four Decades</b></p>
		<p>Using the dynamic structural model developed in LaForest (2019), I estimate and compare the effects of U.S. high school career and technical education (CTE) in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.  I do so by estimating the parameters of the dynamic structural model using restricted-use data from each of the four panel data sets conducted by the National Center for Education Studies: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), High School and Beyond (HS&B), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002).  I compare these results in order to provide context on how the returns to high school CTE have changed over time in the United States, to predict how the returns to high school CTE will change in the future, and to evaluate the robustness of my parameter estimates over time.  Finally, I test how well my model predicts the data by treating ELS:2002 as a hold-out sample and using the trends in the NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 model estimates to predict the data in ELS:2002. A preliminary comparison of results between the ELS:2002 and NELS:88 data sets suggests that the effects of high school CTE on later-life wages and chances of employment in a skilled occupation remained relatively constant between the 1990s and 2000s, but that the effects of trade CTE on overall employment decreased from positive to negligible between the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
